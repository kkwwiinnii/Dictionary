# Dictionary
ECEAC1_Lab Activity 2:
An array composed of key-value pairs, namely engineering terms and definitions, using Python. 

This Engineering Dictionary was created using Pydroid 3. To make the dictionary, the code employed elements such as curly brackets and key-value pairs separated by colons. It also used print functions to display specific messages and inputs to get information from the user. With these elements combined, it produced the output, which is the Engineering Dictionary.
